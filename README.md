  <li>Track each habit everyday. These are the 3 statuses of a habit:
    <ul>
      <li>
        	Done - Mark the habit as done for a day
      </li>
      <li>
        Not done - Mark the habit as not done for a day
      </li>
      <li>
        	None - User did not take any action on a habit for a day
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A view to show all current habits. Here give an add button where you can add a new habit to track. </li>
  <li>A view to display 7 days of each habit</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Show today where user can mark todays habit
    </li>
    <li>
      And show the previous 6 days and the status of that habit for each day
    </li>
    <li>
      A user can toggle between the three (above mentioned) statuses of a habit i.e. I can change todays status as done, not done or none anytime.
    </li>
    <li>
      Also I should be able to change any of the previous days status i.e. I can change the status of a habit for yesterday, day before yesterday or any previous 6 days as well
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>You can create one default user and attach habits to that user </li>
  <li>Store the data in a DB.</li>
  <li>You can keep track of the longest streak and the number of days the user completed that habit</li>
</ul>
